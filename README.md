### Prediction
The proposed HallAssess uses the well-trained models (UniFMIR [1]) and does not need additional training.

Evaluating the quality of super-resolution results
Download the pretrained models from `//`. Place the file in the model file. 

```
cd <directory of the .py file>
python main.py
```
Replacing "FMIRdatapath" with the folder name containing AI-reconstructed images (such as super-resolved images, denoised images), which need to be measured. 

Replacing "LQpath" with the folder name containing low-quality images (such as low-resolution images), which are the input of the AI models (such as super-resolution models) for generating AI-reconstructed images. 

### Data
All training and test data involved in the experiments are publicly available datasets. 

* The 3D denoising/isotropic reconstruction/projection datasets can be downloaded from `https://publications.mpi-cbg.de/publications-sites/7207/`

* The SR dataset can be downloaded from `https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13264793`
